Gleipnir 3D Engine
=================

Gleipnir is a cross-platform Kotlin/Java game engine based on LWJGL. It is (*will be*) 100% genuinely made from dwarven magic; also keeps Fenrir at bay.

This is a work in progress, might not even be finished, as im writing this engine, I am also developing a game in Godot, if you are looking for a cool open source game engine, and want to get into the meat of game development fast see --> https://github.com/godotengine/godot
PS: It is also fully documented & and supports Vulkan ;)

And if java is your thing, look here --> https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine
